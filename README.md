# How Does It Work?:

Players with permissions to use the command that you set in config.lua can do the chat command:
 /ssmonitor [playerId] ["add"/"remove"] 

When they execute this command it will send a discord log that tell you who the admin is that added/removed this player from being auto monitored.

Once the player is added to be auto monitored then after every minute (or however many minutes you set in config.lua) the player will be screenshotted and the screenshot will be sent to discord via webhook

This is good for monitoring suspicious or new players as it will continuously log screenshots of them every x amount of minutes throughout the day every time they join the server and it wont stop until you remove them from being monitored with the command
